Build using make file. g++ 14.2.0 or greater required. Rest, I think I covered all of the dependencies. Use the run file to run the code after building. Place the tests in a a folder that has path and maze files and then place that folder in load folder. You should see a log file appear with the results of all the runs. Press esc after every time a window opens during the batch run. A demo run's log file has been added for the available test cases in load. Please manage the batch files locations accordingly before running in lines 5, 6 and 7(1 based indexing).
